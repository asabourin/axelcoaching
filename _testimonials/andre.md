I came from Portugal to Australia on a Work and Holiday Visa (462 Visa) and at first I was having some difficulties finding a job. Luckily, Alexandra helped me to adapt my resume for Australia, coached me in how to talk to recruitment agencies â€“ this part was very important because in Portugal we usually deal directly with the companies -, and discuss opportunities, salary, as well as career advice. Once she reviewed my CV, I started getting more interest from recruitment agents (and about jobs that were more focused on what I wanted) and was able to find a job quickly!
