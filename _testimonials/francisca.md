When I decided to go live to Australia I had a lot of questions regarding how the job market works here. It can be difficult to fully understand this on your own sometimes, knowing all those “tips and tricks” that will make you more noticeable to recruitment agents and employers. I had Alexandra’s help on this and it made a huge difference! She has extensive knowledge on how recruitment agencies work so she was able to help me with my CV, what to say and do on an interview (and what not so say), what salaries I should expect and pretty much all questions I had! I am on a work & holiday visa (subclass 462) and that can sometimes make it harder to find a good job but with Alexandra’s help it was much easier. I highly recommend her services, it will help you find a better job and simplify a process that can otherwise be very stressful!
