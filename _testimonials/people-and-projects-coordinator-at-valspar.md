Alex provided assistance and mentoring in kick starting my career in Human Resources after graduating from my degree. She specifically gave me guidance on essential do's and don'ts for resumes and interviews. Even now, we keep in touch and Alex always ensures to check in to see how I am going. Alex's guidance and mentorship has provided me with a strong platform as I progress through my career.
