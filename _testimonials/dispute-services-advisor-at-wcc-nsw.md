“Alexandra was invaluable in helping me secure my first job in Australia. Having moved from the UK, I was unaware of the differences between the two markets (UK and Australian). She explained to me the necessity of tailoring my CV to the needs of the Australian job market and helped me achieve that. She has a keen awareness and understanding of the local job market and valuable advice to help candidates like me gain a foothold. She is also one of the most approachable and empathetic people I’ve encountered in this industry. This helps those who are trying to find their feet and need to build some confidence to launch themselves into the career of their choice.”
