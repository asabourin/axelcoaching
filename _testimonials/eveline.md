I highly recommend Alexandra for her recruitment advice. After finishing my PhD in science, Alex helped convert my academic resume into an industry one. There is very little information or help for academics wanting to redirect their career to an industry research position. Her knowledge of the job market, efficient way of reframing my resume and advice on timing of applications was invaluable to the transition into my current role.
