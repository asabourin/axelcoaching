Alexandra has been such a huge help to me as an expatriate living and working in Australia. I had to change jobs on a 457 visa and had 90 days to find a new employer to take over my sponsorship and it was a very trying time. Alex helped me revamp my resume to put my best foot forward in my time sensitive employment search. Without her help, I'm not convinced I would still be here in Sydney. I cannot recommend her enough - she knows the industry and as an expat herself understands how stressful these situations can become.
