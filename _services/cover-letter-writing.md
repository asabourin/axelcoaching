This service allows us to tailor a cover letter for a specific application or a general one as you wish. We ask that you send us your resume so that we can best understand your background, which is then followed by a phone call to ensure we are on the correct path. This service includes a: 

➢	15 minute phone call

➢	Tailored Cover Letter


How does it work?


1.	Once your payment and resume have been received, we will get in touch with you within 1 business day. The phone call is to get an understanding of your current situation, employment history and what roles you are looking to secure with this cover letter.

2.	We ask that you also send us your resume so that we can have a complete understanding of your employment history and are then able to tailor your cover letter to a specific role or for general roles, as you require.

3.	Expect anywhere between 3-7 working days turnaround to receive your cover letter unless you require urgent services which incur a 20% fee subject to our availability. Please do let us know if you require this service and we will try our best to assist you.

4.	Cover letter services are undertaken through the phone followed up via email/phone. Our cover letter service is available to candidates located both in and out of Australia. Phone calls can alternatively be replaced with Skype calls as best suits the candidate’s location. International calls must take place via Skype.
