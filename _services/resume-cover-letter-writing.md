How does it work?

1. ```
   Once your payment and resume have been received, we will get in touch with you within 1 business day. The initial phone call is generally to get to know you personally, understand your motivators and your employment history as well as your career goals.
   ```
2. We will then send you an email with any further specific details we require that may be missing or unclear information that we need to clarify with you about your resume. 
3. Expect anywhere between 3-7 working days turnaround to receive your first resume draft, unless you require urgent services which incur a 20% fee subject to our availability. Please do let us know if you require this service and we will try our best to assist you.
4. You will then receive your first resume draft and have 7 business days to return it to us if you wish to have it amended or change any details.  We, otherwise, consider the service complete. 
5. Resume writing services are undertaken through the phone followed up via email/phone. Our resume writing service is available to candidates located both in and out of Australia. Phone calls can alternatively be replaced with Skype calls as best suits the candidate’s location. International calls must take place via Skype.
6. You will also receive a complimentary copy of our “Complete Guide to Job Hunting” e-book with this service.
